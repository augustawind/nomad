Nomad!
=====
An open-ended, dynamically generated adventure game
---------------------------------------------------

In Nomad you play a wandering nomad on an endless, shifting plains that
changes as it leaves your line of sight. There is no goal, but the nomad
must keep moving in search of food, water, and a safe place to rest.

There is no telling what the nomad will encounter on the plains, for
what lies abroad is known to no one. On the plains, nothing is certain
but this: all paths are one-way.

Development
...........

Nomad works: you can play it until the nomad dies. But there aren't a
lot of things to do right now. As Nomad evolves its world will become
richer and something more akin to a game will appear.
